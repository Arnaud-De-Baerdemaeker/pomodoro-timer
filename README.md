# Pomodoro Timer

This is my Pomodoro timer made with React.js as a project during my formation with BeCode.

## What it can do ?

The timer allows the following :

* freely set a timer between 00:01 and 59:50,
* directly set the timer at 25:00,
* add or substract minutes and seconds from the timer, only when it's stopped
* reset the timer to 00:00,
* when the timer reaches 00:00, a modal pops up inviting to take a little break,
* the modal also give the choice to close itself or to relaunch a timer of 25 minutes.

The timer is also responsive.
